# Below we define a new function naming it 'simple_addition()'
# We give the function two 'parameters' called 'num1' and 'num2'
# The answer is the sum of the values, ask for num1 to be printed and the answer to be printed

def simple_addition(num1,num2):
    answer = num1 + num2
    print('num1 is',num1)
    print(answer)

# we call the function to run it as well as define the variables 'num1=3' and 'num2=5'
simple_addition(3,5)
#! OR 'simple_addition(num2=5,num1=3)'
# This will ensure the numbers are what you want rather than being assigned by iteration
