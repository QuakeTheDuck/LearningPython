Personal notes while learning Python

Learning Python, this is going to be fun. I did dive into python a while ago through Youtuber sentdex(https://pythonprogramming.net) and other resources but I did not reinforce any of my learning or continue trying to learn. I have retained information at random. Now I am writing up everything I learn while watch the videos pausing, playing around with the code, add my own notes for future reference and reinforcement. Each week I plan to go back over the weeks notes and reinforce even more. I believe I have memory problems, might not, oh well.

The main purpose of uploading this to github is to keep track of my progress.
The second reason is to, in the future, allow others to view how I got to where I am going.
Tertiary reasons: fun, learn GitHub, corrupt SSD
